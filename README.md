# Moneyball-Project-1
The files contained in this repository are our first CSV file with over 31,000 rows of data. This file allowed us to complete our graphs and allowed us to run our regression analysis. 

After we created our graphs and regressions, we cleaned the file and limited it to provide data on users who have both a School and a valid State and created the csv file School_State_Data. From School_State_Data, we were able to run our heat map as that file gave a full picture of students with completed profiles giving identification by school and state.
